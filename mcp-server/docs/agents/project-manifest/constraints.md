# Constraints & Conventions

This document codifies established rules, conventions, and non-obvious gotchas.

---

## File System Constraints

### 1. All File I/O Must Be Atomic

**Rule:** Never write directly to target files. Always use the `atomicWriteJson()` function.

**Rationale:** Ensures readers never see partial writes or corrupt JSON.

**Implementation:** Write to `{file}.tmp.{pid}`, then atomically rename to target.

---

### 2. Dual-File Updates Require Locking

**Rule:** When updating both `.ledger/project-ledger.json` and `.ledger/WP-###.json`, always use `LedgerStore.updateWorkPackageWithSync()` or manually wrap with `withLock()`.

**Rationale:** Prevents race conditions and dual-file desync when multiple agents run concurrently.

**Anti-pattern:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — race condition risk
await store.writeWorkPackage(wpId, updatedWp);
await store.writeRootIndex(updatedRoot);
```

**Correct pattern:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT — atomic dual-file update
await store.updateWorkPackageWithSync(wpId, (wp, root) => {
  // ... update both wp and root ...
  return { wp: updatedWp, root: updatedRoot };
});
```

---

### 3. Paths Must Be Absolute

**Rule:** All MCP tool inputs require absolute paths for `project_path`.

**Rationale:** The server has no concept of "current working directory" — it must be told explicitly where files live.

---

### 4. STDIO Logging Discipline

**Rule:** Never log to `stdout`. All logs must go to `stderr`.

**Rationale:** `stdout` is reserved for the MCP protocol. Logging to `stdout` breaks protocol communication.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
console.error('[project-ledger-mcp] Server started');

// ❌ WRONG — breaks MCP protocol
console.log('[project-ledger-mcp] Server started');
```

---

## Schema Constraints

### 5. Work Package IDs Must Follow WP-### Format

**Rule:** All work package IDs must match the regex `/^WP-\d{3}$/` (e.g., `WP-001`, `WP-042`, `WP-123`).

**Enforcement:** Validated by Zod schemas and utility functions (`formatWpId()`, `parseWpId()`).

---

### 6. Timestamps Must Use YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS Format

**Rule:** All timestamp fields use this exact format. Always use the `now()` utility function.

**Anti-pattern:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — inconsistent format
const timestamp = new Date().toISOString(); // "2026-02-16T18:00:00.000Z"
```

**Correct pattern:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT — consistent format
const timestamp = now(); // "2026-02-16 18:00:00"
```

---

### 7. JSON Must Be Pretty-Printed

**Rule:** All JSON files written by the server must use 2-space indentation and include a trailing newline.

**Rationale:** Human readability and clean git diffs.

**Enforcement:** `atomicWriteJson()` automatically formats as `JSON.stringify(data, null, 2) + '\n'`.

---

## Business Rule Constraints

### 8. Status Transitions Are Enforced

**Rule:** Work package status transitions must follow the legal transition table:

| From | To | Special Conditions |
|------|----|--------------------|
| `READY` | `IN_PROGRESS` | Dependencies must be `COMPLETE` |
| `READY` | `BLOCKED` | None |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | `COMPLETE` | All acceptance criteria must be met |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | `BLOCKED` | None |
| `BLOCKED` | `IN_PROGRESS` | None (implicitly means blocker resolved) |
| `COMPLETE` | `IN_PROGRESS` | Triggers revision increment |

**Enforcement:** `isValidStatusTransition()` validator. Illegal transitions throw errors.

---

### 9. COMPLETE Requires All Acceptance Criteria Met

**Rule:** A work package cannot be marked `COMPLETE` unless all acceptance criteria have `met: true`.

**Enforcement:** `canCompleteWorkPackage()` validator in `ledger_update_work_package_status` tool.

**Error message format:**
```
Cannot mark work package as COMPLETE: the following acceptance criteria are not met:
  - Criterion 1
  - Criterion 2
```

---

### 10. Dependencies Must Exist Before Creation

**Rule:** When creating a work package, all dependency IDs must already exist in the root index.

**Enforcement:** `ledger_create_work_package` validates dependencies before creating the work package.

**Rationale:** Prevents dangling references.

---

### 11. BLOCKED Status Requires Blocker Object

**Rule:** When transitioning a work package to `BLOCKED`, the `blocked_by` field must be provided.

**Enforcement:** `ledger_update_work_package_status` throws an error if `status: 'BLOCKED'` is passed without `blocked_by`.

---

### 12. Pipelines Require IN_PROGRESS Work Package

**Rule:** A pipeline can only be started on a work package with status `IN_PROGRESS`.

**Enforcement:** `ledger_start_pipeline` validates WP status before creating pipeline.

**Rationale:** Prevents starting work before a work package is claimed.

---

### 13. No Duplicate IN_PROGRESS Pipelines

**Rule:** Only one pipeline of a given type can be `IN_PROGRESS` at a time for a work package.

**Enforcement:** `ledger_start_pipeline` checks for existing `IN_PROGRESS` pipeline of the same type before creating a new one.

**Rationale:** Forces agents to complete or fail a pipeline before retrying.

---

### 14. Pipeline Comments Have No Agent Field

**Rule:** Pipeline-level comments do not include an `agent` field. The agent is inferred from the pipeline type.

**Convention:**
- `implementation` pipeline → Developer
- `qa` pipeline → QA
- `code-review` pipeline → Reviewer
- `documentation` pipeline → Documentation

**Contrast:** Project-level comments include an explicit `agent` field because they are not tied to a specific pipeline.

---

### 15. Incident Comments Require Context

**Rule:** When adding a project comment with `type: 'incident'`, the `context` field is required.

**Enforcement:** `ledger_add_project_comment` throws an error if `type === 'incident'` and `context` is missing.

**Required context fields:**
- `os` — Operating system where incident occurred
- `tool` — Tool or command that caused the incident
- `work_package` (optional) — Associated work package
- `resolved` — Whether the incident is resolved
- `workaround` (optional) — Workaround description

---

## Concurrency Constraints

### 16. Lock Timeout Is 10 Seconds

**Rule:** File locks have a stale timeout of 10 seconds. Locks older than this are considered abandoned and can be forcibly acquired.

**Implication:** If a process crashes while holding a lock, other processes will wait up to 10 seconds before retrying.

---

### 17. Lock Retry Count Is 5

**Rule:** Lock acquisition is retried up to 5 times with 200ms intervals before failing.

**Total wait time:** ~5 × 200ms = ~1 second (plus stale timeout consideration).

---

## Testing Constraints

### 18. Test Timeout Is 10 Seconds

**Rule:** All Vitest tests have a default timeout of 10 seconds.

**Configuration:** Set in `vitest.config.ts`.

**Rationale:** Integration tests may involve multiple file I/O operations and lock acquisitions.

---

## Module System Constraints

### 19. All Imports Must Use .js Extensions

**Rule:** Even when importing TypeScript files, use `.js` extensions.

**Example:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT
import { LedgerStore } from '../storage/ledger-store.js';

// ❌ WRONG
import { LedgerStore } from '../storage/ledger-store';
```

**Rationale:** Node16 module resolution requires explicit file extensions for ESM.

---

### 20. No Default Exports

**Convention:** All exports are named exports. No default exports are used.

**Rationale:** Improves refactoring and tooling support.

---

## Validation Constraints

### 21. All Reads Are Validated

**Rule:** Every file read operation validates the JSON against a Zod schema before returning data.

**Enforcement:** `LedgerStore.readRootIndex()` and `LedgerStore.readWorkPackage()` both parse and validate.

**Failure modes:**
- File not found → `ENOENT` error
- Malformed JSON → `SyntaxError`
- Schema mismatch → Zod validation error

---

### 22. All Writes Are Validated

**Rule:** Every file write operation validates data against a Zod schema before writing.

**Enforcement:** `LedgerStore.writeRootIndex()` and `LedgerStore.writeWorkPackage()` call `Schema.parse()` before writing.

**Rationale:** Prevents writing invalid data to disk.

---

## Counter Self-Healing

### 23. Project Status Tool Auto-Corrects Counters

**Rule:** `ledger_get_project_status` recomputes `total_work_packages` and `pending_work_packages` from the `work_packages` array on every invocation.

**Behavior:** If counters are incorrect, they are silently corrected and the root index is rewritten.

**Rationale:** Provides fault tolerance against bugs that might cause counter drift.

---

## Development & Build Constraints

### 16. Changelog Is the Source of Truth for Versioning

**Rule:** All version changes must be made in `changelog.md` first, then synced to `package.json`.

**Rationale:** Maintains a single source of truth and ensures version history is documented.

**Process:**
1. Update `changelog.md` with new version header:
   ```markdown
   ## v1.0.2 - 2026-02-20
   
   ### Added
   - New feature...
   ```
2. Run `npm run sync-version` to extract version and update `package.json`
3. The MCP server will display the version at startup in STDERR

**Anti-pattern:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG — manually editing package.json version
vim package.json  # Don't do this!
```

**Correct pattern:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT — update changelog first, then sync
vim changelog.md  # Add new version
npm run sync-version
```

---

### 17. Version Sync Runs Automatically Before Dev

**Rule:** The `predev` hook ensures version is synced before running the development server.

**Implication:** You can skip manual `npm run sync-version` if running `npm run dev` — it happens automatically.

**Manual sync needed when:**
- Building for distribution
- Running in production
- CI/CD pipelines
- Testing version display without starting server

---

### 18. Server Version Displays at Startup

**Rule:** The MCP server logs its version to STDERR on startup.

**Example output:**
```
[project-ledger-mcp] Server v1.0.1 started successfully
[project-ledger-mcp] Transport: STDIO
[project-ledger-mcp] Registered tools: ledger_get_project_status, ...
```

**Purpose:** Allows users and CI systems to verify which version is running in their project.

---

## Gotchas

### ⚠️ Gotcha 1: Revision Only Increments on COMPLETE → IN_PROGRESS

The `revision` field only increments when a work package transitions from `COMPLETE` back to `IN_PROGRESS`. It does not increment on other status changes.

---

### ⚠️ Gotcha 2: Lock File Is Not Cleaned Up

The `.ledger.lock` file is not automatically deleted when the server exits. It will be left on disk and overwritten on the next lock acquisition.

**Implication:** Safe to ignore — the lock system handles stale locks automatically.

---

### ⚠️ Gotcha 3: Metrics Object Is Extensible

The `metrics` object in pipelines uses `.passthrough()` in Zod, meaning it accepts additional fields beyond the predefined ones (`test_coverage`, `tests_passed`, etc.).

**Use case:** Custom metrics for different pipeline types (e.g., `build_time`, `bundle_size`).

---

### ⚠️ Gotcha 4: Work Package Summaries Are Duplicates

Work package summaries in the root index duplicate a subset of data from the work package detail files.

**Reason:** Performance — agents can list work packages without loading all detail files.

**Invariant:** Summaries must always match the corresponding detail files. This is enforced by `updateWorkPackageWithSync()`.

---

### ⚠️ Gotcha 5: READY Status After Creation Depends on Dependencies

When creating a work package:
- If dependencies are empty or all `COMPLETE` → Initial status is `READY`
- If any dependency is not `COMPLETE` → Initial status is `BLOCKED`

This logic is automatic and transparent to the caller.
