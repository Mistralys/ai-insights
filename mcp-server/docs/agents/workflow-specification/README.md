## 1. Overview

The workflow orchestrates **seven specialized agent roles** to execute software development tasks. A **centralized ledger** persists project state, enabling agents to collaborate across independent sessions without losing context.

The core progression is:

```
Planner → Project Manager → Developer → QA → Reviewer → Documentation → Synthesis
```

Work is organized into **work packages** (WPs), each of which progresses through a fixed sequence of **pipelines**:

```
implementation → qa → code-review → documentation
```

Each pipeline is owned by a single agent role. Failures route back for rework. The system enforces ordering, validates transitions, and manages handoffs automatically.
