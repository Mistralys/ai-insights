## Template Engine Limitations

<a name="c5"></a>
<a name="b1"></a>
1. **`{{else}}` blocks are supported.** Conditionals may include an optional `{{else}}` branch: `{{#if flag}}…{{else}}…{{/if}}`. When the flag is truthy, the content before `{{else}}` is kept; when falsy, the content after `{{else}}` is kept. Prefer `{{else}}` over computed inverse booleans.

<a name="c6"></a>
<a name="b2"></a>
2. **Nested `{{#if}}` blocks are not supported.** The template engine uses a single-pass regex that stops at the first `{{/if}}` encountered. Nesting `{{#if}}` inside another `{{#if}}` will silently produce incorrect output. Flatten nested conditions to separate top-level `{{#if}}` blocks or extract to partials.

   **Anti-pattern:**
   ```
   {{#if platform_vscode}}
     {{#if feature_enabled}}
       Content for VS Code only when feature is on
     {{/if}}
   {{/if}}
   ```
   The inner `{{/if}}` terminates the outer block prematurely, leaving stray `{{/if}}` and `{{#if feature_enabled}}` markers in the output.

   **Correct pattern:**
   ```
   {{#if platform_vscode_and_feature}}
     Content for VS Code only when feature is on
   {{/if}}
   ```
   Pre-compute the compound boolean as a variable in the build script (or add it to `_shared.yaml`), then use a single top-level `{{#if}}` block.

<a name="c7"></a>
<a name="b3"></a>
3. **No `{{#each}}` loops.** Iteration must be handled by computed variables. The build script pre-renders `roster_rendered` and `mcp_tools_table` as fully-formed Markdown strings.

<a name="c8"></a>
<a name="b4"></a>
4. **Max partial depth: 2.** Partials can embed other partials, but only to depth 2. Deeper nesting is silently ignored (markers left in output).

<a name="c9"></a>
<a name="b5"></a>
5. **Unresolved markers are preserved.** Unknown `{{variable}}` or `{{> partial}}` markers are left in the output as-is and a `[WARN]` is emitted. This makes typos visible without causing a hard build failure.

<a name="c10"></a>
<a name="b6"></a>
6. **`--strict` mode converts unresolved markers into a hard failure.** When `--strict` is passed, a post-build scan runs on every generated file using the regex `/\{\{>?\s*[\w-]+\}\}/g`. If any markers remain, the script emits `[STRICT] Unresolved marker(s) in <suite>/<target>/<file>: <markers>` to stderr, increments a `strictFailures` counter, and exits with code 1 after the full build completes. The base build output (written files) is unaffected; `--strict` only controls the exit code. Use `node scripts/build-personas.js --strict --suite all` in CI pipelines or pre-commit hooks to gate on zero unresolved markers.

   > **GN-4 — Code-fence false-positive risk:** The `--strict` regex scans the full assembled text and would produce false positives if a template body contained literal `{{…}}` inside a Markdown fenced-code block. **Mitigation active (WP-002):** The build script strips fenced blocks (`/```[\s\S]*?```/g`) from a copy of the output before scanning, eliminating this false-positive risk.

   > **GN-5 — `--check` + `--strict` exit ordering:** When `--check` detects stale output files, `process.exit(1)` fires before `[STRICT]` scan output is emitted. The exit code remains 1 (correct). This is intentional. In CI, run `--check` as a separate pre-build step if `[STRICT]` failure details are needed.

## Log-Prefix Convention

The build script (`scripts/build-personas.js`) uses four bracket-prefixed severity levels for all console output. Use these prefixes consistently for any `console.log` / `console.error` calls added to the build script in the future.

| Prefix | Meaning | Example usage |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `[info]` | Informational — runtime context, no action needed | Suite default announcement at startup |
| `[WARN]` | Warning — recoverable issue, output may still be valid | Unresolved template markers (non-strict mode) |
| `[STRICT]` | Strict-mode failure — gates CI exit code | Unresolved markers when `--strict` is active |
| `[ERROR]` | Fatal — build cannot continue | Missing content file, invalid YAML |

## Build Validation Constraints

7. **`note_only: true` on `mcp_tools` entries excludes them from the rendered tools table.** When an `mcp_tools` entry in a per-persona YAML file has `note_only: true`, the `renderMcpToolsTable()` function filters it out (using `.filter(t => !t.note_only)`) before building the Markdown table. The entry is still present in the YAML source and the tool remains functionally accessible to the agent, but it is not listed as a table row in generated output. Use this flag for tools that agents should be aware of via prose content (e.g., in a `mcp-tools-note.md` partial) but that are not primary workflow tools for that role. Entries without `note_only` are unaffected — `undefined` is falsy and passes the filter without change.

<a name="c35"></a>
<a name="b8"></a>
8. **`--check` mode asserts that `note_only: true` tools are absent from generated output.** Running `node scripts/build-personas.js --check` performs two validations per file: (1) the generated content matches the file on disk (staleness check), and (2) no tool entry marked `note_only: true` in the persona's `mcp_tools` YAML appears as a rendered table row in the generated output. The guard in `build-personas.js` uses a **regex** (`/\|\s*\`toolName\`\s*\|/`) rather than `string.includes()` — this tolerates Markdown table column-spacing variations (e.g., `|  \`toolName\`  |`). Violations increment `staleCount` and are printed to stderr with prefix `[note_only-violation]`. If any violation is found the process exits with code 1.

   > **Why regex over string.includes:** `string.includes('| \`toolName\` |')` is tightly coupled to exact column spacing. A Markdown table reformatter or editor that normalises padding (e.g., `|  \`toolName\`  |`) would silently bypass the check. The regex `\|\s*\`…\`\s*\|` matches any amount of whitespace on either side of the backtick-quoted name, making the guard robust to formatting drift.

## Sync Script Conventions

9. **`vs_file_name` is required for VS Code sync; `name` is required for Claude Code sync.** During VS Code sync, files without a `vs_file_name` field in frontmatter are silently skipped. During Claude Code sync, files without a `name` field are skipped. This excludes `README.md` and any non-persona files.

<a name="c31"></a>
<a name="b10"></a>
10. **Sync reads from explicit source directories.** `syncVSCode()` reads from `ledger/vs-code/`; `syncStandaloneVSCode()` reads from `standalone/vs-code/`; `syncClaudeCode()` reads from `ledger/claude-code/`; `syncStandaloneClaudeCode()` reads from `standalone/claude-code/`. All four copy to their respective target directories without recursively walking the whole `personas/` tree. When `--target vscode` (or `--target all`) is used, both `syncVSCode()` and `syncStandaloneVSCode()` are called. When `--target claude-code` (or `--target all`) is used, both `syncClaudeCode()` and `syncStandaloneClaudeCode()` are called.

<a name="c32"></a>
<a name="b11"></a>
11. **Frontmatter validation is advisory.** `validateVSCodeFrontmatter()` checks `role`, `name`, `vs_file_name`, `id`, and `model` in ledger VS Code personas. `validateStandaloneVSCodeFrontmatter()` checks `name` and `vs_file_name` in standalone VS Code personas (no `role` required). `validateCCFrontmatter()` checks `name` (must match `\d-kebab-case` pattern with numeric prefix), `role`, `permissionMode`, `model`, and `memory` in ledger Claude Code personas. `validateStandaloneCCFrontmatter()` checks `name` (plain kebab-case — **no** numeric prefix, e.g. `agents-md-curator`), `permissionMode`, `model`, and `memory` in standalone Claude Code personas. None of these functions block the sync — warnings are printed to console.

<a name="c33"></a>
<a name="b12"></a>
12. **Build is automatic during sync.** `scripts/sync-personas.js` spawns `scripts/build-personas.js` as a child process before copying files, and forwards the `--target` flag so the build step generates only the required output. There is no need to run build separately when syncing.
